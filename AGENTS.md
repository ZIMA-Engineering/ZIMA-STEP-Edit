# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Core Qt 6 application lives in `src/` with `mainwindow.*`, thread helpers, and `.ui` forms generated by Qt Designer.
- Resources referenced by `zima-step-edit.qrc` sit in `gfx/` (icons) and `locale/` (translation `.ts`/`.qm` files). Keep new assets referenced in the `.qrc`.
- Android packaging files are under `android/`; desktop build artifacts stay beside `zima-step-edit.pro`.
- Keep README/LICENSE/AUTHORS at the repo root; avoid adding build outputs to version control.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Always verify every change with a build: run `qmake zima-step-edit.pro` (Qt 6) and `make`; use `CONFIG+=release` or `CONFIG+=debug` as needed.
- `make clean`: remove build artifacts.
- Run locally with `./ZIMA-STEP-Edit` from the build folder; place translation `.qm` files next to the binary or in `locale/`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow existing Qt 4 idioms: slots/signals via `connect` macros, camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes (`MainWindow`, `FileEditThread`).
- Indentation currently uses tabs; match surrounding file style and keep braces on their own lines as in the existing codebase.
- Include headers locally with quotes; group Qt includes before project headers.
- Update `zima-step-edit.pro` when adding sources, headers, forms, or resources.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test suite exists; exercise critical flows manually: file search, bulk edit, cancellation, and translation loading.
- When adding new logic, prefer small, easily reviewable functions and include a short note in PRs describing manual steps performed (e.g., directories searched, sample file edited).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: concise, imperative subjects (e.g., "Add progress updates during file edits"); group related changes and avoid bundling formatting-only churn.
- PRs: describe the change, risk, and manual verification steps; link issues where applicable. Include platform notes if a change is Windows-only (context menu) or affects localization loading paths.
- Screenshots are helpful for UI changes; annotate differences when modifying `.ui` forms or icons.

## Localization & Assets
- Regenerate translations when strings change: `lupdate zima-step-edit.pro` then `lrelease locale/ZIMA-STEP-Edit_cs_CZ.ts` to produce `.qm`.
- Keep icons in `gfx/` and reference them via the resource file; prefer PNG for cross-platform consistency.
