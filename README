------------------
System context menu works only in Windows. You have to run it once
as admin so it can create the menu in registry.

If you want to use translations, you have to put the translation file
next to ZIMA-STEP-Edit executable or to subdir 'locale', otherwise it won't
be found. ZIMA-STEP-Edit tries to load the language your system is using.
